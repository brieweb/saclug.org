This talk will cover a introduction of mini-computing at home using Linux.
Topics covered will include Rikomagic's MK802 and MK802II based on the All-winner A10 Chip set and Android operating system.
There will be a brief introduction to the Dalvik VM, an overview of Hardware specifications, comparisons of similar devices, as well as a demonstration of stock and custom images.
Recently restricted releases of Chromecast by Google have prompted a revisit to hardware that is Linux-friendly and ships with access to root.
Active participation for this talk is encouraged, so if you have similar devices do not hesitate to bring as a HDTV will be available for demonstration.
