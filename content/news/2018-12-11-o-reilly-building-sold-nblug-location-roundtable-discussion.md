This may be our last meeting at O'Reilly.

NBLUG's first meeting was on June 9, 1998. For the last 20 years we've been hosted for free at O'Reilly Media in Sebastopol, CA. An era is coming to a close as the O'Reilly media building has been sold and the new owners are requiring all groups to provide commercial insurance to continue meeting in 2019. NBLUG is not a legal entity and thus as a group we do not have any legally recognized status to acquire such insurance, our meager cashbox balance notwithstanding. Therefore, the purpose of this meeting is to discuss meeting location options and any possible costs for 2019 and beyond.

This is not a normal NBLUG talk; this is a time for all members new and old to gather possibly for the last time at O'Reilly and discuss the future. The NBLUG board has already met and agreed that any proposals should be put up for a general vote from all attending members in accordance with NBLUG's bylaws. If we are unable to find a solution going forward with O'Reilly this meeting can also be used as a time to convey our thanks to the staff of O'Reilly Media for all of their support over the years in whatever forms the group finds appropriate.

All are welcome to attend this open meeting and contribute to the discussion. This talk will not be streamed due to the nature of the discussion and will start promptly at 7:30.
