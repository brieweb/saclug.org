**Lightning Talks:** Have something you would like to present, but don't have enough material for a full talk?  Here's your chance.  Talk about anything Linux related.

**Hackfest:** Bring your hardware or software project to get help with it or just to show it off. A mix of free tech support, show-and-tell, and idle chat.
