Server security is more important now than ever, yet many of the hardening
guides out there read like they were written a decade ago (probably because
they were!) Modern server hardening can be an obscure and complicated
subject but it doesn't have to be. There are a number of simple and
fast-to-implement steps you can take to dramatically increase the security
of your infrastructure. In this talk Kyle will start with an overview of
security best practices and provide a series of current yet simple
hardening examples effective for securing everything from traditional
bare-metal networks, cloud infrastructure, and even your home network.
