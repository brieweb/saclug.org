This will be an encore presentation of a <a href="https://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-24/dc-24-speakers.html#Cecil">DEF&nbsp;CON talk given August 5th at 4:00&nbsp;PM</a>.  TASBot is an augmented Nintendo R.O.B. robot that can play video games without any of the button mashing limitations us humans have. By pretending to be a controller connected to a game console, TASBot triggers glitches and exploits weaknesses to execute arbitrary opcodes and rewrite games. This talk will cover how these exploits were found and will explore the idea that breaking video games using Tool-Assisted emulators can be a fun way to learn the basics of discovering security vulnerabilities.  An overview of some of the details that will be described in the talk can be found in an article I coauthored for the PoC||GTFO journal issue 0x10 (Pokemon Plays Twitch, page 6).
