Chris will be briefly going over the history of Asterisk. He'll discuss a few available protocols like h.323, SIP, and IAX2. He'll go into a little more detail about IAX2 since it's simple and has low over head. Chris will be demonstrating a simple SIP device. Then make a call from one Asterisk server to another. Maybe even a couple servers hooked to each other. Possibly a call into his home PBX that goes over a VPN tunnel.

NBLUG members are invited to call my PBX by dialing: (707)703-1982 or connecting to: guest@odunix.org with their SIP or IAX2 client.
