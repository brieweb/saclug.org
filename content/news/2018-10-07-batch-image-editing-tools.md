Most of us are familiar with interactive image editors like Paint and Photoshop.  Fewer people are familiar with the batch tools that can be used from the command line.

These non-interactive tools allow images to be processed in bulk from scripts, or converted automatically in a server. In classic Unix tradition, many can be chained together to create complex workflows.

This talk will include a high-level introduction to the ImageMagick and GraphicsMagick tool suites, and a brief overview of several tools with complimentary functionality.
