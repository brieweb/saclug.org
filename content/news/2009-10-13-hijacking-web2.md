Many Websites mix secure and insecure content on the same page, like Facebook. This makes it possible to steal all the data entered on such a page easily, using Moxie Marlinspike's SSLstrip tool. I will explain and demonstrate this attack.

Slowloris is a very new layer 7 denial-of-service attack created by RSnake that stops Apache web servers completely with very low bandwidth--one packet every 2 seconds. The Apache developers were notified of this vulnerability and decided it was unimportant and not worth patching. I will explain and demonstrate this attack, and discuss various ways to protect your Apache servers.

I will hand out complete instructions so that anyone can easily set up both these attacks on their own machines.
