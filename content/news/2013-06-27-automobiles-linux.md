Linux developers play a major role in bringing forth the surprisingly
near-term technology of autonomous vehicles. The talk will present
lessons from a few years of work on vehicular SW and make the case
that automotive software will have an outsized societal impact.
Imminent decisions by government and private industry will influence
how long-running problems like privacy and security play out in this
new space. What code is important in automotive Linux, and what's it
like to work on it? What are the opportunities for software
developers and EE's, and where might one get started?

Alison Chaiken has worked as an automotive software developer for 3
years, starting with MeeGo-IVI at Nokia, continuing as a contractor,
and then joining Mentor Embedded Software Division. She is the
organizer of the Silicon Valley Automotive Open Source Group and rides
bicycles in any time that is somehow left over.
