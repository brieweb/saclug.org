Are you frustrated with the model/router/switch your ISP provides? Curious what your options are to improve performance or regain control? NBLUG will be holding a panel discussion about home networking, focusing on the humble router. We have representatives of several options:

* Improving existing hardware by flashing OpenWRT or similar
* Building your own router from an old PC or single-board computer
* Commercial products aimed at IT professionals

We expect a wide-ranging discussion of the pros and cons of each of these approaches, touching on the effort required, security implications, and flexibility of each option. Questions from the audience are welcome.
