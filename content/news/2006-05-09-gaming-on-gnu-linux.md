Sometimes it seems like as a community we take ourselves too seriously. We
run serious applications and our most important economic demographic is
large corporations with men in very expensive suits. Maybe the reason there
aren't many Linux based home computers is that we're all not playing enough
games.

Stephen Cilley and Paul Peterson present gaming in GNU/Linux. They will
discussing several modern (and not so modern) games and bitch about __ahem__
... discuss the difficulty involved in their use. They will present the
modern alternatives in video cards, processors, and do their best to avoid
the holy war while discussing distribution and windows managers. They will
demonstrate the use and futility of win32 API implementations in Linux along
with native free games and native non-free games.

You might learn something, you might not, but you will have fun.
