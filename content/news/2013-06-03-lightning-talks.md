According to Wikipedia: A Lightning talk is a short presentation given
at a conference or similar forum. Unlike other presentations, lightning
talks last only a few minutes and several will usually be delivered in
a single period by different speakers.

Everyone is invited and encouraged to talk about Linux.

 * Which distro are you running?
 * What hardware are you running Linux on?
 * What projects are you working on?
 * We want to hear about it.

A sign up form will be provided at the beginning of the meeting for
anyone wanting to give a lightning talk.
