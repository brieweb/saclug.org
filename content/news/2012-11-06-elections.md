NBLUG's yearly elections will be held on 2012-11-13. For more information on the positions open, see the Elected Officers section of <http://nblug.org/bylaws>.

After the election is concluded we will have time allotted for lightning talks followed by the announcements of the election result. The remainder of the night will be a hackfest with rumors of a possible code sprint happening.
