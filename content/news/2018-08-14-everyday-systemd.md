Location: O'Reilly Media
Author: Tom Most

The systemd system manager has been adopted by most popular Linux distributions, but it can be a difficult system to understand without any background. This talk will provide a practical introduction aimed at users and system administrators. We will discuss how systemd models the world, teach it how to run a service, and take a look at everyday tasks like customizing existing services and inspecting logs.

Update: This talk was not recorded, but the [slides are available](https://freecog.net/2018/everyday-systemd.pdf).
