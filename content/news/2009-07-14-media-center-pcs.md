It seems like just about everyone is coming out with a PC that you can connect to your TV and play videos from. Of course, we all know just how many of those are running Linux under the hood.

In this talk Kyle Rankin and Allan Cecil are going to discuss two fully-featured programs you can install on a regular Linux system to turn it into a media PC: Xbox Media Center (XBMC) and Boxee.
