A Raspberry Pi is a low power $35 Linux PC the size of a deck of cards with powerful features including hardware-accelerated h.264 video playback at 1080p. In this talk, Allan will present an overview of the educational mission of the Raspberry Pi Foundation, available hardware variants and accessories, precompiled Linux distributions, and a live demo including a demonstration of XBMC playing back HD video.
