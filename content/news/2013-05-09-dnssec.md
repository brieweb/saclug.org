Like IPv6, DNSSEC is one of those great ideas that just hasn't seen widespread adoption yet. That's a shame because it turns out it's not that difficult to deploy DNSSEC for a domain once you have the basic concepts down. In this talk Kyle will talk about general security issues that have plagued DNS over the years, how DNSSEC addresses some of them, how DNSSEC works, and finally how to deploy DNSSEC yourself.
