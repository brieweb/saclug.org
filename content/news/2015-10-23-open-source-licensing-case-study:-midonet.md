Midokura released Midonet under the Apache license in 2014. This talk will explain why Midokura released the software under an open source license and why it picked Apache. In order to understand the options, the business models used with GPL and Apache will be discussed, which will include comparing the rights granted under the two licenses. Midonet will also be explained, at a very high level, to provide context for the decision to make it open source. Please note that this talk should not be construed as legal advice.


The NBLUG elections will be held directly following the talk.  A nominations E-Mail will be sent to the talk list with additional information.
