At 23 years, gnuplot is one of the oldest free and open source programs out in the wild world. It runs anywhere and everywhere. It's an interactive, text-based plotting program that's quite easy to use, and yet can produce surprisingly complex plots. Many features of gnuplot are shown in a live demo.
