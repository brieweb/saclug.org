I'm very sorry to announce that, due to a lack of sign ups, we've chosen to cancel the upcoming installfest (scheduled for Sat. 10/20). Our hope is to schedule another in the spring.

We still want to open the 'fest up to issues beyond simply installing, so if you have suggestions, please send them along. We'd also like to advertise the 'Installfest+' to a wider audience, so please feel free to chime in with your ideas.

Thanks,

-dave. (Installfest coordinator)
