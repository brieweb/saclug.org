With more and more information coming out about how insecure nearly
every computer is, come find out how to make your computer use just a
bit more secure...

In this presentation, Robert will go over how to setup and use a Yubikey
to store PGP keys and PKI certs such that without physical access theft
of the keys is just about impossible, and even difficult with physical
access.

Other security enhancements like hardware password stores (Mooltipass)
and air-gapped machines will be covered. Further, I'm sure there will be
discussion of the recently disclosed Meltdown and Specter attacks.
