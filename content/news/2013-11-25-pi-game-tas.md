A Raspberry Pi, connected to a custom PCB with a PIC microcontroller, connected to... a game console's controller port? In this presentation, Allan will talk about the Tool-Assisted Speedrun community from http://tasvideos.org, game console emulators in Linux, Raspberry Pi GPIO serial interface capabilities, PCB design, reverse-engineering, and how a TAS can be an artform.

There will be plenty of technical details but the presentation should be enjoyable by all, with demonstrations of games being played perfectly using tools to overcome the limitations of human reflexes and a finale of taking complete control of an unmodified Super Nintendo using only the controller input.
