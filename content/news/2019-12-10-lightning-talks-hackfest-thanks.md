**Lightning Talks:** Have something you would like to present, but don't have enough material for a full talk?  Here's your chance.  Talk about anything Linux related.

**Hackfest:** Bring your hardware or software project to get help with it or just to show it off. A mix of free tech support, show-and-tell, and idle chat.

**Partying:** OK, so we don't have prior permission to throw a holiday party at Sonic, but they've been extremely generous to us as our host this year and we can quietly leave the folks that matter a few kind notes thanking them for their support. I said partying as a ruse but I really mean sharing some holiday cheer. Who's with me?
