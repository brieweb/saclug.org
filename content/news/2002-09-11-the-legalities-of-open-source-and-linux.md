Tags: general meeting

Speaker: Larry Rosen
Location: O'Reilly and Associates
Author: Eric Eisenhart

Our speaker this month is an expert on legal issues relating to open source software and intellectual property; instead of a specific pre-planned formal presentation, we've decided to do a Q&A session, so read up, think of some questions (interesting, hard, you're just curious, whatever...) and bring them to the meeting with you. Or you can email [legal-questions@nblug.org](mailto:legal-questions@nblug.org) and we can ask your questions for you.

Larry Rosen is the founding partner of [ROSENLAW.COM LLP](http://www.rosenlaw.com/), a law firm that specializes in intellectual property matters for large and small companies and individuals. He is also the general counsel and executive director of [Open Source Initiative](https://www.opensource.org/), an organization that reviews and approves licenses for open source software. His articles on legal issues relating to open source appear monthly in [Linux Journal](https://www.linuxjournal.com/user/800878). Before he became an attorney, Larry taught computer programming and managed several computer departments at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/). He then worked in private industry, managing computer and applications development. At one large firm he guided the design, implementation, manufacturing and marketing of successful products for data and voice communications.
