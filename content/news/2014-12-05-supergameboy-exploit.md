> This talk is all about dissecting exactly what happens when a program stops doing what the designers designed it to do and starts doing what an attacker (or in this case, the presenter) wants it to do.
> I'll cover using a virtual machine environment of a simple system under Linux to step through all phases of an arbitrary code execution (ACE) exploit, including corrupting a data structure, out-of-bounds memory manipulation, pointer manipulation, and ultimately execution of arbitrary code.
> I'll be demonstrating memory viewer and disassembly tools to show the exact instructions being processed as they happen.

> The simple system in question?
> A Zilog Z80 processor, running inside of a Super Game Boy.
> Come for the dissection, stay for some entertaining abuse of a live SNES console.
> This will largely be a no slides, full demo presentation and should have something of interest for everyone.
> See you there!
