Title: Database Administration with MySQL and PostgreSQL
Tags: general meeting
Event: 2002-08-13 7:30 pm to 9:00 pm
Speaker: Augie Schwer
Location: O'Reilly and Associates
Author: Eric Eisenhart

Augie will be covering both PostgreSQL Database Administration and MySQL Database Administration. So if you've just been dying to set up a database or you have one of these databases and aren't quite sure how to configure it or add users or just don't quite know what to do with it, come to the meeting with your brains ready. We're hoping some of you will be coming with questions ready so that Augie can be properly grilled.

MySQL and PostgreSQL are the two leading open source SQL Relational DataBase Management Systems (RDBMS); both run on Linux as well as a variety of other platforms, mostly \*nix. They are used to power many websites, including slashdot.org, freshmeat.net, SourceForge.net, quickfacts.census.gov, finance.yahoo.com, mail-abuse.org, and more projects than you can shake a stick at. MySQL is a lightweight database engine that does most of what you want; PostgreSQL is a bit heftier but also provides all of what's in the ANSI SQL92 standard. Both can be used from C, C++, Perl, PHP, Java, ODBC and Python.

Augie is a regularly attending member of NBLUG who is currently majoring in Computer Science at Sonoma State University and working for the Sonoma County Water Agency, primarily doing web and database development.
