We're going to hold another regular meeting on Tuesday March 8 at
7:00pm, at Flagship Taproom / Spring Thai in Cotati.  This will be a
social meeting &mdash; there's not really any way to do presentations
outdoors.  If you have any cool toys, projects, anything that doesn't
need a projector or too much table space, feel free to bring them.
We're hoping to be back indoors at some point, but in the meantime
we're trying to keep things going with these casual meetings.

For those who didn't make the February meeting, [Flagship](https://www.flagshiptaproom.com/cotati) and [Spring
Thai](https://www.springthai.net/) are sharing a big outdoor tent with lots of picnic tables, so you
can order good Thai food and/or good beer.

See you there,
