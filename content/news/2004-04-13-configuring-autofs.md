Autofs is a kernel option that lets you automatically mount filesystems on your computer when you access them, and then automatically umount them when they are no longer used.

When I was trying to figure out the best way to set up my removable usb drive, I ended up stumbling upon autofs as an excellent solution. After realizing the potential of it, and how configurable it is, I started setting it up to manage other mountpoints on my system. In this talk, I will discuss everything I set up, and how, including dynamically mounted cdroms, usb drives (including cameras), smb, ftp, and ssh mountpoints.
