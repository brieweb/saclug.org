RedHat Road Tour is a **special event** at a **different** time, but at the usual place.

NBLUG is lucky enough to be the only Northern California stop on the [RedHat](http://redhat.com/) [Road Tour](http://redhat.com/roadtour/).

Four men. Two weeks. Five thousand miles. And one solitary purpose: To discover the state of Linux in America.

From 6:30 to 7:30 there will be general socializing and refreshments; bring $5-$10 for food, though RedHat may help pay for food. Probably order pizza or something.

Then at 7:30 there will be a presentation followed by Q&A.

There will be swag and O'Reilly will be selling books in the lobby.
