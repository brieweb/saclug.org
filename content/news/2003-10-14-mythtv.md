Tags: general meeting
Event: 2003-10-14 7:30 pm to 9:00 pm
Speaker: Scott Doty, Kyle Rankin, and Michael Egan
Location: O'Reilly and Associates
Author: Dustin Mollo

Scott Doty has been working with video encoding with Linux and MythTV to record Television and Video with Linux. He will offer us a review of what he has done and inform us on what he has found to work very well, and what to avoid. This should be an excellent resentation for beginners through advanced users. (ME: remember to bring in your DVD/VCR.)

Kyle Rankin and M.E. will provide a co-presentation to work with video encoding, and include some "neat tricks" with mplayer.
