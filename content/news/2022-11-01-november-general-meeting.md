The November meeting will be Tuesday November 8, 7:00pm.
Same location as last month:

Down to Earth Cafe<br>
8204 Old Redwood Highway, Cotati<br>

It's just across the street from the previous place â€” lagship and Spring Thai are *still* closed.
DTE closes at 8pm (though they usually let us hang out a bit longer), so I'm planning to get there around 6:30.
(I know a bunch of people have been showing up at 6:30 pretty regularly anyway.)

As always, feel free to bring any sort of Linux gadgets, questions, anything you want to talk about, etc.

See you there,

Derek Noonburg<br>
President, North Bay Linux Users' Group
