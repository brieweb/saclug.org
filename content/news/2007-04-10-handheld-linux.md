Several handheld computers are on the market that run(or can be made to run) Linux. In this talk, Bob will discuss the differences between Linux on the desktop and on these little devices. He will compare models from Compaq/HP, Sharp and Nokia, the different window managers, and show some of the applications available. Bob has owned a few different handhelds and will bring a couple of them to demonstrate. Some technical points regarding Linux on small systems will also be brought up.
