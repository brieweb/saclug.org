OpenVPN - Adding Trust to Untrusted Networks

Virtual Private Networks allow you to connect two networks securely.

A traveler with a laptop frequently uses a random internet connection but 
wants to connect securely to a home or office network.

Traditional solutions are not well suited to the random connections of the 
traveler with a laptop.

OpenVPN is a versatile cross-platform open source solution that's easy to set up.

This presentation will have an overview of the lingo and components of VPN and 
a how-to demonstration of an OpenVPN server and laptop client.
