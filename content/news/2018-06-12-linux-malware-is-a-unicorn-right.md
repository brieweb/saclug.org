Linux (and Unix generally) is known for being far more secure than Windows. But is this true? *Is* there such a thing as Linux Malware?  There is, and in this talk I'll present a brief overview of the history of Linux/Unix malware, worms, trojans and viruses.  I'll cover how they spread, what the current outbreak landscape looks like today, where it's likely to head in the future and what you can do to keep yourself safe.

Don't assume that just because you're not running Windows that you've done everything you need to do! If you've got a machine on the net, you could be contributing CPU cycles and bandwidth to a botnet.  Get informed, take some simple precautions and ensure that you're not part of the problem.
