Description:
OpenStack is a set of tools to create a "cloud" infrastructure similar to Amazon's cloud services to manage virtual machines (called instances) across multiple Compute servers in a cluster managed by one or more Controllers.  In this talk I'll introduce the general concepts of what OpenStack can be used for in an approachable way.  I'll provide an overview OpenStack's Controller and Compute node model, how instances work, block and image storage, and a general overview of bridged networking into virtual machines.  The majority of the talk will be devoted to a live demo of spinning up instances with plenty of time for interactive Q and A.
