Tor is a toolset for a wide range of organizations and people that want to improve their safety and security on the Internet. Using Tor can help you anonymize web browsing and publishing, instant messaging, IRC, SSH, and other applications that use the TCP protocol. I will discuss how it works (the onion router and Tor), how to install and run it(its easy!), and how it's a very secure system. I'll also look at the common criticisms, who needs this kind of technology and why, compare the Tor network to other anonymous systems, such as anonymizer, and contrast Tor with traditional proxies. I'll finish up with talking about hidden services Tor can provide, and allow for questions and comments of course.
