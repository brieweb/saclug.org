gumstix, Inc. creates the world's smallest commercially available
Linux boards and computers. Their devices are based on Intel's PXA255
processor with Xscale technology (also used in high-end PDAs and
smartphones), measure only 20mm x 80mm x 8mm -- the size of a stick
of gum -- and cost as low as $109. gumstix boards provide GPIO pins,
serial ports, USB 1.1 client, an MMC flash memory card slot, and
an I2C bus.

Their's are among the first single board computers (SBCs) shipping with
the new Linux 2.6 kernel, with its fully pre-emptible, multi-threading
capabilties.

Gordon Kruberg, Founder & CEO, founded, financed, and played
