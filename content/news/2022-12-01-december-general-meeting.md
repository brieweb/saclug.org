The December meeting will be Tuesday December 13, 6:30pm.  Same location
as last month:

Down to Earth Cafe<br>
8204 Old Redwood Highway, Cotati<br>
[dtecafe.com](https://www.dtecafe.com/)

(Flagship and Spring Thai are *still* closed.  Sigh.)

DTE closes at 8pm, and folks have been showing up a little early
anyway, so I'm just going to set the start time at 6:30 instead of
7:00.  If anyone really hates this, talk to me at the meeting :-)

As always, feel free to bring any sort of Linux gadgets,
old-school mechanical gadgets, questions, anything you want to talk
about, etc.

See you there,

Derek Noonburg<br>
President, North Bay Linux Users' Group
