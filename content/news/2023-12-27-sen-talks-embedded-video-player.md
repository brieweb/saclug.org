## Meeting notes

provided by Gary!

I'd like to thank Brian for hosting the group meeting at Kupros last night.

It was supposed to be mostly social, but we
ended up talking a lot of Linux. He mentioned that his new <a

seemed to have many options for the core configuration and we started
to discuss how this was possible and might have gone off the deep end :)

We looked at some of the details of the C code for the navigation app
and it was interesting to see the API's for accessing the sensor data.
I hadn't played with that stuff for quite a while. We discussed the ease
of accessing sensor data provided by a phone vs usb add on.

And the happy hour snack and beer weren't bad either.
