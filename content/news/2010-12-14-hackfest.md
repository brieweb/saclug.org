Instead of a regular speaker, this month we are going to do a hackfest. Like the previous hackfests we will take half of the meeting to conduct lightning talks from the first four people who sign up for one. After that we will spend the rest of the time in a more loosely-structured social setting where everyone can show each other what they have been working on or ask for help. This would be a good meeting to bring your computers.

During this meeting we will also conduct our annual NBLUG elections. You can find out more about the open positions at [http://nblug.org/bylaws](http://nblug.org/bylaws)
