NixOS is a fully declarative Linux distribution. All system state is precisely described by a handful of configuration files that can be easily backed up or duplicated across machines. The packaging system features fully atomic upgrades and rollbacks, and allows multiple versions of a package to coexist.

A fantastic talk from a local speaker was just on the cusp of being announced when the speaker fell ill. What to do? Why, come hang out and chit chat in the lunch room instead of course â€” our old standby lightning talks and hackfest returns for a second month in a row out of necessity. Stay tuned for next month's talk announcement which should be solid and thanks for the flexibility.

**Lightning Talks:** Have something you would like to present, but don't have enough material for a full talk?  Here's your chance.  Talk about anything Linux related.

**Hackfest:** Bring your hardware or software project to get help with it or just to show it off. A mix of free tech support, show-and-tell, and idle chat.
