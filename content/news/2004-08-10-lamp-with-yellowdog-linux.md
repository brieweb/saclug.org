Matt will be talking about using Linux, Apache, MySQL and Perl/PHP/Python (LAMP) on Yellow Dog Linux, TerraSoft's Fedora-like Linux distribution for the Mac architecture.

When the opportunity arose for me to borrow some old hardware from my office, I jumped at it in hopes of running my own webserver from home. I was allowed to use a Mac PowerPC. Naturally, I looked into Linux on the Mac architecture and, fearing Debian, decided to try out Terrasoft's Yellow Dog Linux. I plan to speak on how it was I came to install YDL on decade-old machine and my experiences with running LAMP on it.
