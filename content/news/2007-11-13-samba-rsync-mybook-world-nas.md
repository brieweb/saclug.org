This talk covers storage and backup in a home or small office where files
are stored on a single server running Linux or on a Network Attached
Storage device. Files are shared to Windows, Linux, and OSX using Samba.
Every day all files are backed up to an external USB hard drive using
Rsync.

Network Attached Storage drives can save space and electricity by serving
files to multiple clients without the need for a computer. The Western
Digital MyBook World is a NAS with gigabit ethernet, a USB host port, and
500GB to 2TB of storage. It runs Linux internally and has a full system
and GNU development environment preinstalled.

There will be a demonstration and also a look at some RAID controllers and
a NAS drive, with performance critiques.
