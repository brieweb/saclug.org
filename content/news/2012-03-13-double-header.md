What is longer than a lightning talk but shorter than a normal talk? This month you'll find out as we have two different speakers giving talks:

**Mike Higgins**:

Title: "Life without an Evil Cellphone Company"  
Summary: Why Cellphone Companies are Evil. How I hacked a 'Droid phone without realizing it. Using Skype and Wifi hotspots to make calls on my Droid phone without a cellphone carrier. Trouble in paradise (things are not working perfectly yet).

**Jezra:**

Title "Creating a media player that suits my needs"  
Summary: Jezra will discuss the *what, why, and how* of creating media playing software that is (hopefully) suitable for a low end HTPC.
