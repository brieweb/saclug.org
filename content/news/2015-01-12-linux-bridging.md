Tags: general meeting
Event: 2015-01-13 7:30 pm to 9:00 pm
Speaker: Robert Harker
Location: O'Reilly Media
Author: Tom Most

Linux bridging is one of the seven mysteries of Linux.
What is the br0 device and how does it use the NIC?
What is virbr0?
The answers to these and many other questions will be answered including how virtual instance use bridges and how they interact with the host's IPtables.
The goal of this talk is to give the Linux Sysadmin the understanding needed to configure, use and trouble-shoot Linux bridges.

Robert Harker is a [Linux|UNIX] greybeard sysadmin and one of the first Sun sysadmins.
His interests include OS/application configuration management of scaling of server farms with a particular interest in verification of deployments: "How do you know it is correct and running?"
