We've opted to hold the general meeting and elections this coming Tuesday, February 8th at 7 PM at Flagship Taproom and Spring Thai in downtown Cotati, just off Laplaza Park.
Both are open on Tuesday night and they share an outdoor tent (online at [flagshiptaproom.com](https://www.flagshiptaproom.com) and [springthai.net](https://www.springthai.net) â€” credit goes to Tom Most who scouted the locations for us).

See you next week,
