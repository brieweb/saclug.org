This month we are going to do something a little different. Instead of having a formal presentation, we are going to experiment with a "Hackfest." What this means is that we will have free-form lightning talks for up to the first half of the meeting, and then reserve the last half of the meeting so everyone can hack on things or just sit around and chat about Linux. The lightning talks are open to anyone so if you have something interesting you have been working on and could present on it for 5-10 minutes, we will have a sign-up sheet for you at the beginning of the meeting.
