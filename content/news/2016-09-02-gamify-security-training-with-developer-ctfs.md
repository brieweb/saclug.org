Capture the Flag tournaments have long been used to test hacker skills but
they can also serve as effective security training for developers. This
talk will feature a case study where I turned teams of developers with no
prior security training against each other in a CTF arena featuring their
own applications and watched them rack up points as they popped shells in
each other's applications.
