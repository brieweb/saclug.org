Chris will discuss [GNOME Accessibility](http://developer.gnome.org/projects/gap/) features, including screen reading and magnification, plus how to configure X and Gnopernicus to use a second monitor for magnification. One or two accessible live Linux distributions will also be demonstrated.

Accessibility is enabling people with disabilities to participate in substantial life activities that include work and the use of services, products, and information. Gnopernicus is designed to enable low vision or totally blind users to use the Gnome Desktop, through screen magnification, text to speech, text to Braille and other assistive features.

Update: Chris will have relevant materials up at http://www.waggie.net/accessibility/ shortly.
