You used to install Linux with floppy disks or CD-ROM. If you have a lot of
servers, want to live in the 21st century, or just don't feel like getting
up from your desk you should abandon that approach in favor of PXE
booting over the network. In this talk Kyle will give an introduction to
how PXE and kickstart/preseed installations work and follow up with how to
adapt Debian and Ubuntu's preconfigured PXE menus to create your own
custom nice-looking PXE menu installer.
