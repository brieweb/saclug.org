Have you ever been asked to provide feedback on beta software? If so, you've been put in the role of a tester, and effectively communicating what you see when things aren't working the way you expect them to can be challenging. In this talk Allan will cover the context-driven approach to testing with an emphasis on how to troubleshoot problems, how to report what you see in the most effective manner, and how to know when it's time to stop testing an area and focus your time elsewhere.
