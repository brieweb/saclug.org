CTL is a new open source project for enterprise management, written 
in Java, but with bindings to Python, Perl, Ruby, shell, Javascript,
and more. CTL is not an acronym; think of what 'apachectl' does for
the Apache webserver, and imagine what such a tool might do for your
entire enterprise and you've got CTL.
