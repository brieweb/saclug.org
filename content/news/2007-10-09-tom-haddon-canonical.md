Tom works for Canonical, the makers of Ubuntu, Kubuntu, Edubuntu, etc. as a
Systems Administrator for [Launchpad](https://launchpad.net) and
[Landscape](https://landscape.canonical.com).

From Tom :

"The main topic of the talk will be about a volunteer project undertaken
by the SF-LUG to resurrect a housing authority's computer lab using
Edubuntu. How the project started, where we are now, and where we go
from here. Possibly with a demonstration of LTSP (the Linux Terminal
Server Project) on my laptop. I'll also be happy to answer any questions
I can about Ubuntu, Canonical, Launchpad, Landscape, etc."
