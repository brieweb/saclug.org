Greetings,

We have still been unable to meet in person due to COVID-19 restrictions but I continue to hope all are well. I'd like to announce that we'll be doing an online general meeting on Tuesday, December 14th at 7 PM PST at https://meet.jit.si/NBLUGGeneralMeetingDec2021 (to be confirmed) in order to attend to our board elections. I do not intend to continue as President to allow me to focus on TASBot charity work and I encourage others with leadership experience to consider self-nominating during the election process.

We have not had any speakers come forward since the COVID-19 restrictions started other than a passing offer from Kyle and we do not currently have any talks scheduled so for the moment this is a meeting to handle elections and discuss future meeting methods that may work. Our talk email list remains open for conversing, as does our #nblug channel on Libera IRC. Thanks,

A.C.<br>
President, North Bay Linux Users' Group
