In this presentation, we'll get to know Git intimately enough to
anticipate its every move.  We'll develop a visual mental model for a
Git repository.  Then we'll explore how every-day Git commands
manipulate that model.  Along the way, we'll find ways to peek into
Git's inner world to confirm our understanding.  This is not an
introduction to Git; it targets a developer who can commit, branch,
and merge with Git.  Although I'll show example commands and output,
consider bringing a laptop with Git installed so you can type along.
