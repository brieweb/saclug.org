The meeting will begin with the yearly election of members of the NBLUG Board of Directors.

Following the election, Kyle Rankin will be presenting "Practical 3D printing and the Open Source Community".

Your average geek has probably heard of 3D printers but may not know about all of the Open Source underpinnings that have made the 3D printing boom possible. In this talk Kyle will discuss the similarities between the history of hobbyist 3D printers and the history of some popular Linux distributions. He will then talk about some of the 3D printers available today and help you justify buying your own 3D printer with examples of useful things you can print for around the house.
