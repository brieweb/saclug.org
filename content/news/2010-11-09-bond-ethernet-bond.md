When a server is used in production, you want every possible level of fault tolerance. Ethernet bonding allows you to create redundant NICs on a server so that you can lose a NIC, a ethernet cable, or even potentially a switch, without downtime.

In this talk Kyle will introduce the concept of ethernet bonding, discuss the different bonding modes, and describe how to set up bonding on Red Hat and Debian-based systems.
