Hope everyone enjoyed their Memorial Day weekend.  And that means it's
almost time for the next NBLUG meeting: Tuesday June 14, 7:00pm, same
location as the last few meetings: Flagship Taproom / Spring Thai in
Cotati.  Feel free to bring any sort of Linux gadgets, questions,
anything you want to talk about, etc.

For those who haven't been to the previous meetings, [Flagship][flagship] and
[Spring Thai][springthai] are sharing a big outdoor tent with lots of picnic tables,
so you can order Thai food and/or beer.

See you there,

President, North Bay Linux Users' Group
