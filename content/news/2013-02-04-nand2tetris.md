This unique talk will cover the NAND part of the open source
<http://nand2tetris.org/> project, which has an aim of showing how to build a
general-purpose computer system from the ground up. This talk will take
advantage of the Nand2Tetris hardware simulator running under Linux to delve
into how NAND gates alone can be used to build other logic gates and complex
circuits. The talk's focus and depth will be driven by audience feedback
and will range from physical gate construction and logic gate simulation to
the Nand2Tetris project's end educational goals.
