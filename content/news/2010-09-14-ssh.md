SSH is one of the most widely used network protocols. Much more than a replacement for telnet, SSH has many tricks up its encrypted sleeve and harnessing them is a rite of passage for any keyboard cowboy. In this talk, Aaron will discuss the core protocol itself, the history of development and how you can use OpenSSH to better secure your packets through the tubes.
