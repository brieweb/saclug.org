Visual Basic allows anyone, even beginners, to do Windows programming.

You can create powerful graphic applications just by dragging and
dropping widgets onto a form and typing a couple of lines of Basic.

Gambas takes rapid application development even further, and makes it
more powerful - with access to QT and KDE functions just a couple of
mouseclicks away - and it's for Linux!

In this presentation you'll get a quick introduction to the Gambas
development environment and see how easy it is to build a webcam
application.
