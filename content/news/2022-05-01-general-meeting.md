It's coming up on time for another outdoor meeting.  Mark your
calendars for Tuesday May 10, at 7:00pm, same location as the last few
meetings: Flagship Taproom / Spring Thai in Cotati.  Bring your Linux
gadgets, questions, and ideas.

For those who haven't been to the previous meetings, [Flagship](https://www.flagshiptaproom.com/cotati) and
[Spring Thai](https://www.springthai.net/) are sharing a big outdoor tent with lots of picnic tables,
so you can order Thai food and/or beer.


See you there,

Derek Noonburg<br>
President, North Bay Linux Users' Group
