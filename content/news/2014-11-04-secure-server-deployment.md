It's easy to secure your servers when they are in the safe confines of your
own data center, but deploying servers in the cloud is like dropping them
from a helicopter into a jungle across enemy lines without so much as an IP
address. This talk will cover how to use Puppet to harden cloud servers
including certificate and key management, protecting secrets on your hosts,
managing dynamic IPs, and overall security best practices. While a few tips
will be specific to Puppet and Amazon AWS, most of the techniques would
apply in just about any environment.
