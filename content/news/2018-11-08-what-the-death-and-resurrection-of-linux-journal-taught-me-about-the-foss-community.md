Title: What the Death and Resurrection of Linux Journal Taught Me about the FOSS Community
Tags: general meeting
Event: 2018-11-13 7:30 pm to 9:00 pm
Speaker: Kyle Rankin
Location: O'Reilly Media
Author: Tom Most

Linux Journal Magazine was founded in 1994 and coincided with the release
of Linux 1.0. It has been around for most of the history of Linux and has
seen the FOSS community grow and change from that point up to now. The
Linux and Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) community is not the same as
it was in 1994 and this change contributed to Linux Journal's death in
December 2017 and the overall loss of momentum in the Free Software
movement. This talk will tell the story of Linux Journal's death and
resurrection and what it says about the changes in the FOSS community and
what those changes mean for the future of Free Software.

Please stick around after the talk for the yearly NBLUG elections.
Nominations are now open and can be made on the talk list.
