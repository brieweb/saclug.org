Have you ever wondered what is clogging your Internet connection? Or if
you ever use (or get) the bandwidth you pay for? The best way to know is
to measure.

This presentation will discuss how to retrieve data from sources ranging
from Linux hosts to network and IoT devices using collectd, then storing
and graphing the data using InfluxDB and Grafana. The intended audience
is technically-inclined home users and system administrators.
