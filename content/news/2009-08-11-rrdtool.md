Everyone likes pretty pictures. Visualizing your data is one of the
best ways to see the "Big Picture"â„¢ and a great tool to do that
is RRDtool. In this talk, Aaron will discuss the basics of how to use
RRDtool, how to write RRDTool scripts in bash and python, including some
discussion on cricket and munin. Aaron also will give a few demo examples
of some interesting graphs and generic scripts he created for the talk.
