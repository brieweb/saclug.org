According to Wikipedia:  A Lightning talk is a short presentation given at a conference or similar forum.  Unlike other presentations, lightning talks last only a few minutes and several will usually be delivered in a single period by different speakers.

Everyone is invited and encouraged to talk about Linux.
- Which distro or window manager are you running?
- What hardware are you running Linux on?
- What projects are you working on?
- We want to hear about it.
