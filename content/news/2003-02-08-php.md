This month's topic is a continuation of our October meeting discussing the popular PHP (PHP Hypertext Preprocessor) web scripting language. Mark will be going beyond basic PHP into more intermediate topics. PHP is a widely-used general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited for Web development and can be embedded into HTML.

Mark Linford currently works at Santa Rosa Junior College, and amongst his other duties, he writes various PHP scripts, some of which talk to MySQL databases. Previous to working at SRJC he worked with PHP at several other companies.
