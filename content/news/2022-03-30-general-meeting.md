Weâ€™re going to keep going with the outdoor meetings for now.
The next one will be Tuesday April 12, 7:00pm, same location as the last two
meetings: [Flagship Taproom](https://www.flagshiptaproom.com/cotati) / [Spring Thai](https://www.springthai.net/) in Cotati. 
Feel free to bring any Linux-y toys or gadgets.

For those who haven't been to the previous meetings, Flagship and
Spring Thai are sharing a big outdoor tent with lots of picnic tables,
so you can order Thai food and/or beer.

See you there,

Derek Noonburg<br>
President, North Bay Linux Users' Group
