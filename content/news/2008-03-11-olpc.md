The Asus EeePC and the One Laptop Per Child XO are two small laptops with very
little in common. This month we have two presenters, Allan Cecil and Brandon
Williams.

Allan will talk about the One Laptop Per Child Project XO laptop, which
is technologically very unusual and supports some exciting educational and
networking applications. A mesh networking demo of multiple XOs is planned, so
if you are one of the lucky ones to already have an XO, bring it along and join
in the demo.

Brandon will be discussing the EeePC, its hardware specifications, 
capabilities, the default operating system, and its great suite of open 
source software. He'll discuss some of the niche distros popping up 
specifically for the EeePC, some of the popular hardware hacks floating 
around the web, and discuss some available options to the potential 
buyer. We'll also hear about upcoming Ultra-Mobile Pc's, why their popularity
will continue to grow, and upcoming technology that are going to keep making 
them cheaper, smaller, and more portable.
