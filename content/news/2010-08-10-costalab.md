The U.C.S.C Long Marine lab includes the 'costalab', where I work
taking care of 4 servers, mostly Ubuntu, and a few windows desktops.

The costalab studies marine mammals and birds all over the world.
Google on 'costalab' to find out more about what we do.

About half of the talk will be specific to the costalab work - what
information the researchers collect, how it is stored and analyzed,
the benefits to the world from this research, etc. This should be of
interest to a much wider audience than linux gurus.

The rest of the talk will be about our Ubuntu servers, how they are
configured, how they are used, and particular tools that get heavy use
(including Python, rsync, NX, rsnapshot,geany, Ksplice, and Postgres).
A Q&A session will follow.
