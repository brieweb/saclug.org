Title: Ada
Tags: general meeting
Event: 2020-01-14 7:00 pm to 8:30 pm
Speaker: Brian Lavender
Location: Sonic
Author: Tom Most

If you have been programming within the last twenty years or
so, you may have heard of Ada and the Department of Defense
language that seemed to have flopped and so many people
loathed and eventually failed in minds of many programmers.
Yet in contrast, you may have come through the university on
the Pascal track with fond memories.  Ada, brings with it
its Pascal influence and has continued to march forward.
Or, maybe you saw the video of a C-130J transport plane
doing a full loop operating on fly by wire flight controls.
Whatever it is, Ada has marched forward and has been making
strides in the field of secure software programming.  Brian
will talk about the use of SPARK/Ada using contracts and
Ada's static software analyzer relative to secure software
programming.  Second, he will talk about learning Ada using
JGrasp and the available learning resources.

Brian Lavender has been a long time GNU/Linux hacker with a
passion for secure software programming.  His day job is
doing Java development for the Bureau of Real Estate
Appraisers (Department of Consumer Affairs for State of
California).  He also teaches at Sac State as a part time
lecturer teaching Programming Methodologies and Concepts II.
