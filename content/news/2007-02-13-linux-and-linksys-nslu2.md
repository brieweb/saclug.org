The Linksys NSLU2 (Network Storage Link Unit) is a small NAS devices
(Network Attached Storage). The NSLU2 is most often referred to as the
"SLUG" by the Linux community built around it, due to the appearance of
its acronym. The NSLU2 runs Linux out of the box, due to this Linksys
was forced to release the source code under the GPL, opening it wide
open for anyone looking for a cheap/silent/small server. This talk
will cover Firmware Options, Installation of Firmware, Overclocking,
Installing a full version of Debian, and some cool uses for a "Slug".

As a small side note, I will also show how to use Linksys's new
Wireless G camera (WVC54G) in Linux. The talk will also feature the
Linksys WRT54G,and some related differences between it and the
"Slug". Please leave the salt at home.
