This is a Special Event in an unusual location. This is the same building as our InstallFests, but in a room on the second floor. Sorry, but no food allowed.

The movie runs for about an hour and a half, and we plan to start it right at 2:00PM, so plan to show up around 1:40PM.

We plan to show the high-quality special edition DVD version of this film on a large projection television, but, depending on shipping speeds, we may be forced to show a lower-quality version instead. If we have the special edition by then, and if enough people are interested, we may also show some of the extras after the main event.

REVOLUTION OS tells the inside story of the hackers who rebelled against the proprietary software model and Microsoft to create GNU/Linux and the Open Source movement.

On June 1, 2001, Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer said "Linux is a cancer that attaches itself in an intellectual property sense to everything it touches."

Microsoft fears GNU/Linux, and rightly so. GNU/Linux and the Open Source & Free Software movements arguably represent the greatest threat to Microsoft's way of life. Shot in cinemascope on 35mm film in Silicon Valley, REVOLUTION OS tracks down the key movers and shakers behind Linux, and finds out how and why Linux became such a potent threat.

REVOLUTION OS features interviews with Linus Torvalds, Richard Stallman, Bruce Perens, Eric Raymond, Brian Behlendorf, Michael Tiemann, Larry Augustin, Frank Hecker, and Rob Malda. To view the trailer or the first eight minutes go to the [ifilm](http://www.ifilm.com/ifilm/product/film_multimedia/0,4470,2419320,00.html) website for REVOLUTION OS.
