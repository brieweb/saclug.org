Tags: general meeting
Event: 2003-03-11 7:30 pm to 9:00 pm
Speaker: Nick Moffitt
Location: O'Reilly and Associates
Author: Eric Eisenhart

The LNX-BBC is a mini Linux-distribution, small enough to fit on a CD-ROM that has been cut, pressed, or molded to the size and shape of a business card.

LNX-BBCs can be used to rescue ailing machines, perform intrusion post-mortems, act as a temporary workstation, and perform many other tasks that we haven't yet imagined.
