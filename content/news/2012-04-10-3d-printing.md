Kyle just got a 3d printer and loves show and tell. In this talk Kyle will give an overview of 3d printers and then dive into how to get started with 3d printers on Linux. He'll cover some of the different software choices for firmware, slicing, and overall printer control and also discuss printer calibration, ABS vs. PLA plastic, and some of the 3d printer options out there today. He might even risk a live demo.
