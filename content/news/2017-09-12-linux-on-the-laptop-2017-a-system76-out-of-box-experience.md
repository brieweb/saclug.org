You've probably heard of the mythical "Year of the Linux Desktop" for quite some time by now with the year seemingly always just around the corner.  With Linux just now crossing the 3% install base threshold we may not be "there" yet but that's not to say there aren't some great companies out there making Linux-specific hardware.  Case in point is the topic of this talk - System76 (http://system76.com) ships laptops in a range of sizes and configurations with Linux preloaded.

In this talk, I'll demonstrate a new System76 Oryx Pro laptop and show off the current Out-Of-Box experience as well as their plans for their own distribution named Pop!_OS which is now in development.  I'll talk about what works well with their current software loadout and areas that still need improvement.  I'll also give an overview of the current state of driver support and touch on how that support dictated the hardware build of the laptop.  I'll leave plenty of time at the end for everyone to get some hands-on time as some things (such as what the keyboard and button layout feels like) can't be demonstrated well from a projector.
