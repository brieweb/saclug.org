Instead of a regular speaker, this month we are going to do a hackfest. Like the previous hackfest we will take half of the meeting to conduct lightning talks from the first four people who sign up for one. After that we will spend the rest of the time in a more loosely-structured social setting where everyone can show each other what they have been working on or ask for help. This would be a good meeting to bring your computers.

Also this month we invite you to bring any computer hardware you think other members might be interested in for a hardware swap.
