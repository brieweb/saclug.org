Blue Mug, Inc. invites the North Bay Linux Users' Group for a presentation and discussion of a project developing a prototype device using embedded Linux. Topics will include hardware selection, kernel and driver issues, software selection, user interface design, and hacking on the Gtk+ GUI.

Blue Mug, Inc. is an engineering consultancy company in Berkeley that writes software for mobile consumer devices. Devin Carraway and Chuck Groom are project engineers. Devin used to be an NBLUG board member and a periodic presenter before he moved out of Sonoma County, but we twisted his arm and he's coming back for a meeting this month. Chuck focused the latter portion of his undergraduate career on AI research and robotics. A brief sojourn at a dot com nurtured his fanatical attention to usability concerns. At Blue Mug, he continues his interests in tight code and user interface design and implementation.
