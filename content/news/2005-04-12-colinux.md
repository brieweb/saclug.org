Mark will talk about coLinux, a free and open-source method for running Linux on top of Windows.

From the official site ([http://www.colinux.org](http://www.colinux.org)):

"Cooperative Linux (short-named coLinux) is a port of the Linux kernel that allows it to run cooperatively alongside another operating system on a single machine. For instance, it allows one to freely run Linux on Windows 2000/XP, without using a commercial PC virtualization software such as VMware, in a way which is much more optimal than using any general purpose PC virtualization software."
