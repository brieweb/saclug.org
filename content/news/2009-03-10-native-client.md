Google's Native Client project seeks to provide high-performance, cross-platform, browser-based applications yet allow them to be "untrusted". Performance is in the form of x86 binary code while Security comes from a dual layer sandbox. In this talk I'll overview the goals of the project, how it works, why you might care plus give a demo of a few Native Client applications.
