[Ruby on Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.org/) is an open-source web framework that's optimized for programmer happiness and sustainable productivity. It lets you write beautiful code by favoring convention over configuration."

Rob will demonstrate the creation of a simple database driven web application using the Rails framework. He'll also talk about some of the best practices that Rails brings to the web programming table and how it, and projects like it, are making programming more fun.
