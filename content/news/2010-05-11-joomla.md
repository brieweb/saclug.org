Joomla is a content management system (CMS), which enables you to build multi-user Web sites quickly. Many aspects, including its ease-of-use and extensibility, have made Joomla the most popular free and open source Web site software available. Joomla, which operates on top of a LAMP stack (Linux/Apache/MySQL/PHP-perl), is designed to be easy to install and set up even if you're not an advanced user. Many Web hosting services offer a single-click install, getting your new site up and running in just a few minutes. If your clients need specialized functionality, Joomla is highly extensible and thousands of extensions (most for free under the GPL license ) are available in the Joomla Extensions Directory.

In the talk, Doug Bierer, founder of [unlikelysource.com](http://unlikelysource.com/), which maintains an open source Joomla extension, will cover:

+ what is Joomla and why it may be useful to you
+ rapid website development using Joomla
+ expanding beyond the core by installing extensions
+ how you can write your own Joomla modules
