I will give a brief talk about how we used a modified Pocket Radar unit, a Raspberry Pi board, and an HDTV to implement a radar speed sign.
The talk will include a brief overview of how the Pocket Radar works and what modifications were done to interface it to the Raspberry Pi.
In addition, I'll explain a little about the webpage development and how it is run on the Raspberry Pi.
Also, I'll cover what software was used on the Raspberry Pi, along with what configuration file changes where done.
I will bring a demo system so that people can see the sign in operation.
