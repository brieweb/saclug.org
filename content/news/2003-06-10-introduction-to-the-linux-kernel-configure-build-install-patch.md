This is our normal monthly meeting at the normal scheduled time and place. The "Acting President of NBLUG" will jabber on about installing and upgrading a kernel by building it from source. "Why?" will be covered, and general procedures to make the process easier will be included. He hopes to make this an intermediate level presentation.
