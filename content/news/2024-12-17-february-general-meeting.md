Diego will present Web services in Clojure with Compojure.

Have you ever wanted to learn Lisp?

Clojure is a modern Lisp running on the Java Virtual Machine to build Web servers.

In this talk, we'll learn a little bit about Lisp and its history and variants, understand how to operate Lisp systems, install Clojure, start a Compojure project, and build a simple Lisp-based web server in Compojure that will output a factorial function.
