Title: Life After Second Life: Metaverse
Tags: general meeting
Event: 2016-04-12 7:30 pm to 9:00 pm
Speaker: Mike Higgins
Location: O'Reilly Media
Author: Robert P. Thille


A follow-on talk to a <a href="http://nblug.org/node/155/">previous
talk</a> Mike Higgins gave here at NBLUG in the past about programming
in the video game Second Life.  This time he'll talk about Life After
Second Life.  There is a larger world, a Metaverse, of open source
MMORPGs based on the open source Second Life Viewer projects and the
Open Simulator project.  There are hundreds of small companies trying
to make a living doing what Second Life did.  There are thousands of
crazy artists creating 3D environments and inviting you to walk
through them, there are tens of thousands of people setting up virtual
environments on their own PCs and all of these are starting to link up
to each other.  My plan is to not have many slides for this talk, but
log onto several different virtual worlds and put them up on the Big
Screen while I talk.  Eventually taking us to my private world run off
the server in my barn.
