Have you been wondering what you are going to do with all those high-powered graphics cards you bought now that Bitcoins have declined in value? Why not use them to crack passwords? In this talk Kyle Rankin will discuss the basics of how to use the processing power of your graphics card to crack various types of password hashes.

We will also hold our 2011 NBLUG Board elections at this meeting to be sure to turn up and vote.
