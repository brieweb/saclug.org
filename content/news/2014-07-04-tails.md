With everything we know now about spying and hacking from the hacker next
to you in the coffee shop all the way to government surveillance, now's as
good a time as any to learn how to protect your privacy and anonymity. The
Tails project provides a live bootable disk that sets up a secure
anonymous session on any computer with all traffic routed over Tor. In this
talk Kyle will discuss how to download and verify the latest Tails release,
and demonstrate some of the more advanced features of Tails including its
persistent encrypted storage.
