The October meeting will be Tuesday October 11, 7:00pm.
There's a new location:

Down to Earth Cafe<br>
8204 Old Redwood Highway, Cotati<br>
[dtecafe.com](https://www.dtecafe.com/)

It's just across the street from the previous place.
Flagship and Spring Thai are closed indefinitely due to some sort of electric problem.
DTE closes at 8pm (though they let us hang out a bit longer last month), so I'm planning to get there around 6:30.
(I know a bunch of people have been showing up at 6:30 pretty regularly anyway.)

As always, feel free to bring any sort of Linux gadgets, questions, anything you want to talk about, etc.

See you there,

Derek Noonburg<br>
President, North Bay Linux Users' Group
