To understand how Qubes secures your desktop, look to your pantry. The same security by compartmentalization concept that makes Qubes resilient against attack was conceived of over two hundred years ago to protect food against infection. In this talk Kyle will discuss how to jam strawberries, can green beans, and isolate desktop workflows into a combination of netVMs, proxyVMs, and appVMs. He'll cover some common threats against your food and data and describe how Mason jars and Qubes can mitigate them.
