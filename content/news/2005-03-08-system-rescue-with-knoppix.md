Knoppix is a complete Linux distribution that runs directly from CD. One of its most popular uses is as a rescue and recovery CD since it includes a wide range of incredibly flexible tools to fix a computer that won't boot.

In this talk Kyle will discuss a number of different system recovery scenarios and how to use Knoppix (or another live CD) to restore both Linux and Windows systems. Among the recovery scenarios, Kyle will cover:

- Restoring the Linux boot loader
- Recreating the partition table from scratch
- Imaging hard drives, including drives with failures
- Collecting forensics data on compromised systems
- Scanning Windows systems for viruses
- Editing the Windows registry from Knoppix
- Others
