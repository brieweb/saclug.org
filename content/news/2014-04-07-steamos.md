I'll be firing up my SteamOS box (built from various pieces I cobbled together) and demonstrating this distribution based on Debian Wheezy that's designed for a 10-foot experience, i.e. sitting on a couch.
I'll be showing how Valve configured the OS and how XBMC and even Netflix support can be added.
I'm almost positive there will be some 4-player local co-op going on by the end of the meeting.
In other words, expect a live demoâ€”there's no need for slides for *this* presentation! :)
