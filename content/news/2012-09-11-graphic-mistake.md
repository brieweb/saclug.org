This is a short talk describing an algorithmic error made by the speaker when writing code to draw some geometric objects on paper. Most of the objects displayed just fine, but some were shifted to wrong places on the page. Finding the cause of the problem was a bit of a mystery until an "Ah ha" event occurred. No sophisticated experience with graphics programming is required of the audience. The main ingredients are scaling and translation, rather basic operations which are explained in the talk.
