In this talk Kyle will talk about DNS, the boogeyman in the network troubleshooting world, and explain not only how to tell when DNS isn't the cause of your problems, but also dive into DNS troubleshooting so you'll know for sure when it's to blame. Kyle will cover troubleshooting techniques aimed at the entire DevOps organization. DevOps-style collaboration is great for rapidly developing and deploying software, and when you apply those techniques to troubleshooting, problem solving gets the same benefits.
