[ContinuingLogo](https://github.com/luvisi/continuinglogo) is a recently written interpreter for the Logo programming language that is still in pre-alpha.
It is mostly compatible with Brian Harvey's UCBLogo interpreter and has some graphic and sound features inspired by Atari Logo for the Atari 800.
Logo was created at MIT and BBN in the late 1960s as a language to support children in learning mathematical and logical thinking.
Its most well known feature is turtle graphics, in which a "turtle" moves around on the screen as instructed, drawing a trail behind it.

This talk will consist of a brief tour of some of ContinuingLogo's basic features, followed by demonstrations of several short example programs.
Language demos will include an incredibly short pig Latin translator.
Graphics demos will include spirals, fractals, line followers, and a traffic simulation.
Sound demos will include the generation of music and sound effects, and illustrations of the relationship between sound frequencies and perceived musical notes.
A few larger games will be demonstrated but not discussed line by line.
