[Knoppix](http://knoppix.org/) is a complete Linux distribution that runs directly from a bootable "live CD" allowing you to run Linux on any PC you happen to be in front of.

Kyle has recently finished a book for O'Reilly, [Knoppix Hacks](http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/knoppixhks/), and his talk will provide an introduction for people who are new to the Knoppix live CD distribution, as well as talk a bit about the features in the new Knoppix installer, and how to use Knoppix to repair other Linux systems.
