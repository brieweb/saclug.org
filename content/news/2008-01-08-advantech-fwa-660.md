Paul Stagnoli and Brian Davidson, of Exchange Bank, will be discussing
hacking the Advantech FWA-660 network appliance. The FWA-660 specs
include four Ethernet ports, a Celeron processor, up to 512 meg of ram,
on-board USB and printer support, compact flash support, and a 30 gig
hard drive.

Paul will demonstrate how to install Ubuntu server onto the box via PXE.
Brian will discuss case mods he made to add USB and Printer support to
the box.

The takeaway will be that beyond the pre-packaged solutions hitting the
market, there are other viable options for creating a home "appliance"
that can act as a router, firewall, and file server all in one small,
yet reasonably powerful box.
