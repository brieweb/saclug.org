Tonight is a roundtable hackfest of anything Linux or Open Source related.  A projector will be available for anyone who wants to use it to present something but this is generally an opportunity for a more loosely-structured social setting where everyone can show each other what they have been working on or ask for help. This would be a good meeting to bring your computers or projects.
