I am planning on talking about wireless tools.

I plan on covering Kismet and if I have time, I will also cover some bluetooth stuff.

So if you have ever wanted to map your local wireless networks to a vector map with street names, or you want to superimpose SSIDs on a photo of your state from space, feel free to join us.
