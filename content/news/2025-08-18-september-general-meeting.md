We have a change of topic for the September meeting. 

Have you ever used the Liferay *Digital Experience Platform*? The next meeting, we will do a little exploring in Liferay.

We will investigate [Liferay](https://liferay.dev/) [form](https://learn.liferay.com/w/dxp/low-code/forms/creating-and-managing-forms/creating-forms) creation and [special field types](https://learn.liferay.com/w/dxp/low-code/forms/developer-guide/writing-a-custom-form-field-type). 

We attempted to create a [simple form field file upload](https://github.com/brieweb/liferay-c2p8), yet we couldn't seem
to access the documents and media repository through the API. You can
check the source on Github.
