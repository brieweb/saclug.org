The Epiphany is a processor that tries to combine the best attributes of a CPU and a GPU.
The Parallella is a single-board computer that runs Ubuntu, originally designed as a showcase for the Epiphany chip.
I backed the original Kickstarter campaign for the Parallella in 2012.
I will talk about my experience with the fundraising campaign, how the Epiphany and the Parallella are different from their predecessors, and the strengths and weaknesses of the Epiphany in practice.

Update: William has [posted his slides](http://www.wtracy.com/parallella-presentation.pdf).
