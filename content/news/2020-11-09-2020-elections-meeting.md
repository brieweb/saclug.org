Greetings,

We have been unable to meet due to COVID-19 restrictions and I hope all are well.
I'd like to announce that we'll be doing an online general meeting on Tuesday, November 10th at 7 PM PST in order to attend to our board elections.
Our scribe, Frank, will be handling the election process and will shortly send out nomination instructions.
A meeting link will follow.

We have not had any speakers come forward since the COVID-19 restrictions started and we do not currently have a talk scheduled so for the moment this is a meeting to handle elections.
Our talk email list remains open for conversing, as does our #nblug channel on <del>Freenode</del> <ins>Libera.Chat</ins> IRC. Thanks,

A.C.<br>
President, North Bay Linux Users' Group
