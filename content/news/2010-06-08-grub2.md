Just when you had gotten used to using GRUB instead of LILO, Ubuntu goes and changes GRUB to GRUB2. It turns out that the similarities between the two boot loaders end at the name. In this talk Kyle will go over the differences between GRUB and GRUB2 and discuss the new configuration files, which files you should and shouldn't touch, and why the Esc key no longer works at boot time. There will be a group counseling session at the end of the meeting for disaffected users.
