Working on an engineering project with more than one person is hard enough when everyone is in the same room.
It’s more difficult when you have a team spread around the world and even more interesting if you’re working on a shared physical device.
In this talk, I’ll discuss a remote engineering environment I created that allows contributors to connect to a standard Linux user account with a shared terminal (tmux), shared desktop (x2go with desktop sharing enabled), power and data control for a device under test (serial over USB), and even streaming video for viewing camera feeds (RTMP streaming from OBS Studio and viewed in VLC).
This wide-ranging talk is appropriate for all levels of experience and will primarily be a series of live, remote demos.
